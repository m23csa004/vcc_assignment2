# VCC Assignment 2

This repository contains the setup and configuration steps for deploying a **Virtual Machine (VM) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** with auto-scaling policies and security configurations.

## Assignment Overview

The objective of this assignment is to:
- Deploy a **Virtual Machine (VM) instance** in GCP.
- Implement **auto-scaling policies** to dynamically adjust resources based on workload.
- Configure **firewall rules** for securing access to the VM.
- Set up **IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies** to control permissions and access.

## Steps Implemented

1. **Virtual Machine Setup:**
   - Created a VM instance in GCP using Compute Engine.
   - Configured machine type, disk, and network settings.

2. **Auto-Scaling Configuration:**
   - Set up an instance group to manage VM scaling.
   - Defined an **auto-scaling policy** based on CPU utilization.
   - Configured minimum and maximum instance limits.

3. **Security Configurations:**
   - Configured **firewall rules** to allow/deny specific traffic.
   - Set up IAM roles and policies for access control.
   - Enabled **SSH key-based authentication** for secure access.

## Usage

To replicate the setup, follow the instructions in the report (`Report.pdf`).
